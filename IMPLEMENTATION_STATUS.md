# NORTH30 Load Allocation Implementation Status

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Layout Function Error (FIXED ✓)
**Problem**: `visualize_network_topology.m` was using unsupported `layout` function
**Solution**: Replaced with simple circular and force-directed layout algorithms
**File**: `visualize_network_topology.m:42-95`

### 2. Distributed Generation Constraints (FIXED ✓)
**Problem**: Negative loads (distributed generation) were not appearing in results
**Solution**: Updated constraints to allow negative load values
**Changes**:
- Lower bound: `lb = -150 * ones(n_load_buses, 1)` (allows up to 150MW generation per bus)
- Upper bound: `ub = 350 * ones(n_load_buses, 1)` (allows up to 350MW load per bus)
- Clear constraint messaging about distributed generation
**File**: `realistic_load_allocation.m:78-86`

### 3. Load Allocation Accuracy (IMPROVED ✓)
**Problem**: Poor load allocation accuracy reported by user
**Solution**: Enhanced optimization with better constraints and flow matching
**Improvements**:
- Constrained optimization with `fmincon`
- DC power flow for stability
- Branch flow matching objective function
- Power balance constraints

## Current Implementation Features

### Core Scripts
1. **`realistic_load_allocation.m`**: Main inverse problem solver (PREFERRED)
   - Uses only branch flow measurements (realistic scenario)
   - Allows distributed generation (negative loads)
   - DC power flow for stability
   - Comprehensive validation and visualization

2. **`visualize_network_topology.m`**: Network visualization
   - 2D bus positioning with branch numbering
   - Color-coded by bus type and power flow
   - Fixed layout algorithm issues

3. **`north30_matpower.m`**: MATPOWER case file
   - 42-bus, 30-generator system definition
   - Foundation for all power flow calculations

### Key Technical Features
- **Inverse Problem Formulation**: Estimates loads from branch flow measurements
- **Distributed Generation Support**: Negative load bounds for renewable energy
- **Realistic Constraints**: Based on practical power system operations
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Load and flow error analysis with visualization
- **Robust Optimization**: Uses `fmincon` with multiple constraint types

## Test Status

### Completed Tests
- ✓ MATPOWER case file validation
- ✓ DC power flow convergence
- ✓ Basic load allocation functionality
- ✓ Constraint implementation verification

### Ready for Testing
- Network topology visualization (layout function fixed)
- Realistic load allocation with distributed generation
- Branch flow matching accuracy

## User Instructions

### To Run Load Allocation (Recommended)
```matlab
realistic_load_allocation
```

### To Visualize Network
```matlab
visualize_network_topology
```

### To Test Distributed Generation Constraints
```matlab
test_distributed_generation
```

## Expected Results

### Load Allocation Performance
- Should show some buses with negative loads (distributed generation)
- RMSE should be reasonable (depends on system observability)
- Power balance should be maintained
- Flow matching should converge

### Visualization Output
- 2D network topology with numbered branches
- Bus classification by type (load, generation, slack)
- Connection matrix visualization
- No layout function errors

## Next Steps for User

1. **Run the realistic allocation**: `realistic_load_allocation`
2. **Check for distributed generation**: Look for negative load values in results
3. **Verify visualization**: Run `visualize_network_topology` 
4. **Analyze performance**: Review RMSE and correlation metrics
